“Campus Activity Registration Portal”
A college is developing a Python-based portal to manage student participation in campus activities such as cultural events, sports, and workshops.
You are required to help develop different components of this portal using only the Python topics provided in your syllabus (excluding file handling).
Answer the following sub-questions based on the case.
Q1. Data Types & Operators
The portal collects the following data: student name, age, and marks in 3 internal assessments.
Store age as an integer, marks as float values, and roll number as a complex number (with imaginary part 1).
Using arithmetic operators, calculate total and average marks.
Use comparison operators to check if the student is eligible for activity participation (average ≥ 60).
Q2. Program Flow Control
Use if–elif–else to assign performance grade (A/B/C/Fail).
Use a for loop to print each mark separately.
Use a while loop to repeatedly ask whether the student wants to enroll in another activity until they type "no".
Demonstrate break, continue, and pass with appropriate messages inside loops.
Q3. String Operations
The activity names are stored as strings.
8. Access characters of an activity name using indexing and slicing.
9. Use len(), .find(), and comparison between two activity names.
10. Traverse the activity name using a for loop and print each character.
Q4. Lists & Tuples
Each student may register for multiple activities.
11. Store activity names in a list and perform:
append
insert
pop
slicing
Store fixed student details (name, roll number, grade) in a tuple and print each element.
Q5. Dictionaries & Sets
The college maintains activity data.
13. Create a dictionary mapping student names to their list of registered activities. Demonstrate:
adding entries
updating entries
deleting a key
looping through dictionary items
Store unique activities in a set and demonstrate:
adding items
removing items
union
intersection
Q6. Functions (All types from syllabus)
Create a function that calculates a student’s grade based on average marks.
Create a function with default arguments to display student information.
Create a function with variable-length arguments (*args) to accept multiple activity names.
Create a function that returns multiple values at once (using a tuple).
Q7. Exception Handling
The portal must not crash due to invalid inputs.
19. Use a try–except block to handle ValueError when converting age or marks.
20. Use multiple except blocks for different exceptions.
21. Demonstrate nested try–except while reading student marks and processing grade.
22. Use a finally block to display a completion message.
23. Create a user-defined exception InvalidMarksError and raise it when marks are below 0 or above 100.
